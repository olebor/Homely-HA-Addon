This Home Assistant add-on allows you to integrate your Homely devices with Home Assistant through MQTT, without needing to modify your Home Assistant OS installation or create separate Docker containers.

## Features

- Automatic discovery and creation of Homely devices in Home Assistant
- Real-time state updates through WebSocket connection
- Persistent device information storage using SQLite
- Easy configuration through the Home Assistant UI
- Supports various Homely devices including:
  - Sensors
  - Alarms (status only)
  - Motion detectors
  - Other Zigbee devices supported by the Homely API

## Prerequisites

- Home Assistant OS installed
- MQTT Add-on installed and configured in Home Assistant
- Valid Homely account credentials

   ```

2. Install the "Homely-HA-Addon" add-on from the Add-on Store

3. Configure the add-on (see Configuration section below)

4. Start the add-on

## Configuration

Configure the add-on through the Home Assistant UI by setting the following options:

```yaml
homely:
  username: "your.email@example.com"
  password: "your-homely-password"
mqtt:
  host: "core-mosquitto" # Use this if using the Mosquitto add-on

```

## Supported Devices

This add-on supports all devices that are accessible through the Homely API. However, please note the following limitations:

- Some devices may not be available through the API, including:
  - Yale Doorman
  - Alarm Panel

## Device Discovery

Devices are automatically discovered and created in Home Assistant using MQTT discovery. Each device will appear with appropriate entities based on its capabilities.

## Troubleshooting
